## Lessons Learned

What did I learn while building this project? What challenges did I face ?

**Drop Down  App Learnings :**

I have learned about ***animateFloatAsState***

**...**  Imagine you're controlling a light switch. Flipping it instantly changes the light state, but wouldn't it be cooler if the light smoothly dimmed or brightened? That's what animateFloatAsState does in Compose!

***Understanding 0f and -90f : ***

0f : Represents no rotation (flat).

-90f : Represents a 90-degree rotation clockwise around the X-axis.
